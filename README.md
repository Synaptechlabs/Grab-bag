# 🧰 Grab-bag

A collection of miscellaneous C++ (and other language) experiments, old-school coding patterns, and fun little code gems — mostly written for curiosity, study, or sheer nostalgia.

## 📦 What's in the Bag?

This repo contains:

- 🔁 Permutation experiments (recursion, backtracking, and output patterning)
- 🔍 Sorting algorithm implementations (selection sort, insertion sort, etc.)
- 🧠 Logic experiments in loop design and output formatting
- 💡 Small utilities or classic-style functions for exploration
- 🧓 Retro coding flavor — a nod to Pascal, Fortran, and old-school CS

## 🧪 Why?

This isn't a polished library — it's a playground for tinkering, reviving old patterns, and exploring new quirks. Many of the snippets were written to understand how things work under the hood or just for the joy of it.

## 🗂 Example Files

| Filename              | Description                                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `permute.cpp`         | Recursive string permutation example        |
| `selection_sort.cpp`  | Classic in-place selection sort (C++ style)|
| `loop_partition.cpp`  | Reverse-forward split output using loops    |

## 🤖 Compatibility

All code is written for C++17 or later, with some C-style influence. Where applicable, future snippets may include Python, Zig, Rust, or even Pascal (for fun).

## 📜 License

MIT — use, fork, remix, and enjoy.

## 🧠 Author Notes

Created by someone who learned to code in the 80s and still enjoys figuring things out from scratch. This repo is a reminder that old-school problem-solving still rocks.
